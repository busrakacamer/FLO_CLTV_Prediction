# Customer Lifetime Value 

Customer lifetime value (CLV) is the total amount of money a customer is expected to spend with your business, or on your products, during the lifetime of an average business relationship. This is an important figure to know because it helps you make decisions about how much money to invest in acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones.

Knowing the CLV helps businesses develop strategies to acquire new customers and retain existing ones while maintaining profit margins.
